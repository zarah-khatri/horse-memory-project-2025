# Horse-Memory-Project-2025
Horse Memory project: Science Project 2025


Can a horse remember a person it met only one time? I think the horse will remember me the second/third time because I was kind and gave it a treat. I expect it to come faster, act more relaxed, and maybe recognize me.


# Methods & Procedures:


Get Permission from a horse owner at the farm.
Prepare Materials:
Stopwatch or phone
Treats (if allowed)
Notebook and pencil
Grown-up helper

 Visit 1:

Stand outside the horse individual stalls .
Say hello gently, offer a treat, and watch how the horse reacts.
Use a timer to record how long it takes the horse to come to you.
Write down notes: Did it seem nervous or calm? How close did it come?
Wait 3–4 Days. Do not interact with the horse.

 Visit 2 & 3:

Repeat the same steps exactly.
Record the horse’s behavior again.
Safety Precautions
Always have an adult present.
Approach calmly and never from behind.
Feed treats safely and wash hands after.
Don’t run, yell, or scare the horse.
